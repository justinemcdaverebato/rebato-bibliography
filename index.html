      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Justine Mcdave E. rebato , and I am currently a Grade 12 ICT student with a strong interest in technology, creativity, and game design   I have been curious about how technology influences the way people communicate, work, and live their everyday lives. This curiosity gradually developed into a passion for understanding not only how systems function, but also how they can be designed to be intuitive, efficient, and meaningful for users.

What truly inspires me about technology is its ability to simplify complex tasks and bring people closer together through thoughtful design. I am particularly passionate about it , as it allows me to combine logic, creativity, and empathy to create better experiences. Through my academic journey, I continuously seek opportunities to learn, experiment, and improve my skills by working on various projects that challenge my problem-solving abilities and creativity.</p>
